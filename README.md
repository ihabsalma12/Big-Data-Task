# Next Sentence Prediction

Our major task involves training machine learning and deep learning models to predict entailment, contradiction, or neutrality between two sentences. This task is also known as sentence similarity, or recognizing textual entailment and is a well-known natural language inference task. Next sentence prediction in the context of pre-training BERT involves this task as well. We used two datasets, Stanfrod Natural Language Inference (SNLI) and a custom Modern Arabic dataset (source: https://github.com/fraunhofer-iais/arabic_nlp/).
